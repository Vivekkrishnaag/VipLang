# Virtual Interfacing Programming Language (VIPL)

VIPL (Virtual Interfacing Programming Language) is a domain-specific language (DSL) with a syntax similar to Python, designed for flexible and intuitive virtual interfacing. VIPL offers a streamlined syntax and Python-like functionality, making it approachable for those familiar with Python while providing features specific to interfacing tasks. The VIPL compiler is implemented in Java, ensuring performance and portability.

## Features

- **Python-like Syntax**: Easy-to-read and concise, VIPL offers familiar Python syntax, making it accessible to Python developers.
- **Domain-Specific Language**: Focused on virtual interfacing, VIPL is optimized for tasks such as resource management, interfacing, and more.
- **Java-based Compiler**: VIPL's compiler is built in Java, providing cross-platform support and reliable performance.
- **Dynamic Typing and Interfacing Features**: Supports complex expressions, object-oriented programming, and flexible interfacing capabilities.
- **Indentation-based Structure**: Like Python, VIPL relies on indentation for code blocks, making it clean and visually intuitive.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run VIPL, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK** (version 11 or higher)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **IDE** (optional, but recommended for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalkrishnaagQwy/VipLang/
   cd VipLang
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

3. Run the VIPL compiler:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

### Examples

#### 1. Hello World

A simple program to display "Hello, World!" in VIPL:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 2. Variables and Data Types

VIPL supports dynamic typing. Here’s how you can define and print variables:

```groovy
var message = "Welcome to VIPL"
var count = 42
var pi = 3.14
var is_active = true

print(message)
print("Count is", count)
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Is active?", is_active)
```

#### 3. Functions

Define and call functions in VIPL similarly to Python:

```groovy
def greet(var name)
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")
```

#### 4. Control Flow

VIPL includes basic control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `while`.

```groovy
var age = 18

if age >= 18
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

#### 5. Loops

VIPL supports loops with `for` and `while`. Here’s an example of both:

```groovy
# While loop
var count = 0
while count < 5
    print("Count is", count)
    count += 1

# For loop
for i in range(5)
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

#### 6. Object-Oriented Programming

VIPL supports object-oriented programming. Here’s an example of defining a simple class:

```groovy
class Person
    def Person(name, age)
        this.name = name
        this.age = age

    def introduce():
        print("Hi, I am " + this.name + " and I am " + str(this.age) + " years old.")

# Create an instance of the Person class
p = Person("Alice", 30)
p.introduce()
```

### Running VIPL Programs

To run a VIPL program, save your code in a `.vipl` file and pass it to the VIPL compiler:

```bash
java -cp bin Main path/to/your_file.vp
```
